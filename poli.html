<h1 style="text-align:center;"> Privacy Policy <br></h1>
As part of our commitment to your privacy, Thinkwell Group, Inc. (hereinafter, “Thinkwell,” “We,” “Our,” or “Us”) wishes to disclose Our information practices (“Policy”). <br>

<h3>Information Collection and Use <br></h3>

<h3>Cookies <br></h3>
 
Thinkwell may utilize cookies so that We can better understand how to improve the experience of visiting the Site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about your use of the Site. We will use reasonable efforts to ensure that usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. <br>

<h3>Log Files <br></h3>

<h3>Links <br></h3>

The Site contains links to other Web sites. Please be aware that Thinkwell is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other Web sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the privacy policies of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Policy applies solely to information collected by the Site. <br>

<h3>Mailing List <br></h3>

If you indicate that you wish to sign up for Our mailing list, or to sign up to receive press releases via email, We may request that you provide contact information and other relevant information. <br>

<h3>Security <br></h3>

The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to Us. We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification. All of your information is restricted in Our offices and only employees who reasonably need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. <br>

From time to time, We review Our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite Our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. <br>

<h4>If you have any questions about the security at the Site, you can send an email to brains@thinkwellgroup.com. <br></h4>

<h3>Correction/Updating Personally Identifiable Information <br></h3>
